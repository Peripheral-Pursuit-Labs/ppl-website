          <p>Peripheral Pursuit Labs LLC ("PPL," "we," "us," or "our") is a Florida limited liability company and software development studio specializing in native iOS applications, web applications, and API development.</p>

          <h3>2. Services</h3>
          <h4>2.1 Scope of Services</h4>
          <p>We provide custom software development and consulting services including, but not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Native mobile application development (iOS, macOS, Android)</li>

          </ul>

          <h4>2.2 Individual Agreements</h4>
          <p>Specific project work will be governed by individual written agreements ("Project Agreements") that outline scope, deliverables, timelines, and compensation. Project Agreements take precedence over these general Terms for specific engagements.</p>

          <h3>3. Engagement Process</h3>
          <h4>3.1 Discovery</h4>
          <p>Initial consultations and discovery conversations are provided at no charge to assess project fit and requirements.</p>

          <h4>3.2 Proposals</h4>
          <p>Following discovery, we will provide a written proposal outlining scope, timeline, and cost. Proposals are valid for 30 days unless otherwise specified.</p>

          <h4>3.3 Acceptance</h4>
          <p>Work begins only after both parties have signed a Project Agreement and any required deposits have been received.</p>

          <h3>4. Payment Terms</h3>
          <h4>4.1 Fees</h4>
          <p>Fees are specified in individual Project Agreements and may be structured as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fixed-price projects</li>
            <li>Time and materials (hourly or daily rates)</li>
            <li>Retainer arrangements</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>4.2 Invoicing and Payment</h4>
          <p>Unless otherwise specified in a Project Agreement:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Invoices are issued bi-weekly or monthly</li>
            <li>Payment is due within 15 days of invoice date</li>
            <li>Accepted payment methods include bank transfer, check, and approved payment platforms</li>
            <li>Late payments may incur a 1.5% monthly interest charge</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>4.3 Deposits</h4>
          <p>Fixed-price projects typically require a deposit of 25-50% before work begins. Deposits are non-refundable once work has commenced.</p>

          <h4>4.4 Milestone-Based Payment (Projects $30,000+)</h4>
          <p>For larger projects, payments are structured in milestones based on project phases. Each milestone payment is due at the start of that phase, ensuring consistent project progress. Milestone structure is determined during the proposal phase and clearly outlined in the Project Agreement.</p>

          <h3>5. Intellectual Property</h3>
          <h4>5.1 Client Ownership</h4>
